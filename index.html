    <h1 id="privacy">trAIn Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 1, 2024</p>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> June 1, 2024</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how the trAIn mobile application (“App”, “we”, “our”, “us”)
      collects, uses, stores, and protects information about people who create accounts,
      build workout plans, or interact with AI-powered coaching features. By using trAIn,
      you agree to the practices described below.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following types of information when you use the App:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account Data:</strong> Name, email address, authentication tokens, subscription
        status, and profile details such as goals, units, experience level, or custom profile names.</li>
      <li><strong>Workout History:</strong> Generated workouts, exercise selections, logged sets,
        timers, and historical performance data so we can personalize future sessions.</li>
      <li><strong>AI Interactions:</strong> Prompts sent to OpenAI and the responses returned.
        Requests are encrypted in transit and processed according to OpenAI’s data policies.</li>
      <li><strong>Device & Usage Data:</strong> App version, crash logs, device model, and aggregated
        analytics used to improve stability. We do not collect GPS or precise health sensor data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Authenticate you and maintain your account.</li>
      <li>Generate and personalize workout plans and summaries.</li>
      <li>Sync workout history across devices via Firestore.</li>
      <li>Monitor performance, detect abuse, and debug issues.</li>
      <li>Send important updates related to features or billing.</li>
      <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain personal data while your account is active. If you close your account, we delete
      or anonymize your information within 30 days unless required otherwise for legal or security purposes.
      AI request logs may be retained for up to 90 days for debugging.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Share Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share data with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Firebase (Google Cloud Firestore), authentication providers,
        analytics tools, and hosting services — all bound by obligations to protect your data.</li>
      <li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> Minimal structured data is sent to generate workouts. All prompts
        are encrypted and subject to OpenAI’s privacy practices.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> If required to comply with laws or protect users’ safety.</li>

      <li>Request account deletion by emailing us.</li>
      <li>Opt out of marketing communications at any time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use technical and administrative safeguards including encrypted network connections,
      access controls, and monitoring. No system is 100% secure, so we encourage strong passwords
      and secure devices.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not intended for children under 16. We do not knowingly collect information
      from children. If we learn of such data, we will delete it promptly.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy to reflect new features or regulations. If significant changes occur,
      we will notify you within the App or by email.
